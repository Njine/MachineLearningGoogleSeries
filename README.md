# MachineLearningGoogleSeries

This repo contains all of the source code needed in order to run the examples of all Machine Learning recipes from the Google series you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw

I've taken the liberty to make a few modifications along the way, such as:

1) Fixing warnings and upgrading deprecated functions.
2) Using Python3 instead of Python2.
3) Adding remarkable quotes as well as considerations so we don't miss the important points.
4) Adding extra code (for example, to visualize something in the data) so it becaomes easier to understand what is going on.
5) Getting rid of Docker. Some of the recipes use a pre-built Docker image in order to make things easier. However, I believe one learns better when they set up something by themselves. I've replaced Docker with new instructions instead, whenever Docker was needed in the original series.
