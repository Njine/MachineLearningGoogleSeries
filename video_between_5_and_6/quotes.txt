"Wide and Deep learning combines the power of memorization and generalization"

"Wide and Deep learning is useful for generic large scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs"

"TF Learn (formerly SK Flow) is a high level machine learning library on top of TensorFlow"

TF Learn has a "fit" method (used to train your model, just like SciKit Learn)
TF Learn has a "evaluate" method (used to predict, same as SciKit's "predict" method)
